# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction System
The Loan Default Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan based on historical loan and borrower information. This project aims to assist financial institutions in risk assessment, credit decision-making, and minimising loan defaults.
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to compare performance and interpretability

# 🎯 Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan data

- Handle categorical and numerical features

- Build and evaluate multiple ML models

- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics

- Identify important features influencing loan default

- Create a robust and reproducible ML pipeline
